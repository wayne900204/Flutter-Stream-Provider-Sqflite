## Write something nice here!

First, thank you for your interest in contributing. This project is me recording my learning journey.

## How to start edit

If you have suggestions for any place and hope your changes can be integrated back, according to the major differences in the changes can be divided into:
1. Direct modification via Github
2. Through Fork and Pull Request

### Modify directly via Github

As long as you want to modify any file, you can directly click the **Edit** button, and edit and modify directly on the browser.
After the modification is completed, a Pull Request will be automatically created. Then the relevant management personnel will do the final check and make a decision whether to merge.

### Through Fork and Pull Request


If the modified content is too large to be modified directly on the Github interface, the modification process is as follows:
1. First click `Fork` in the upper right corner to create your private project
2. Clone the content from your private project
3. Make adjustments locally
4. `Push` to your project
5. Create a `pull request`
6. Next, a manager will do a final check and decide whether to merge.
